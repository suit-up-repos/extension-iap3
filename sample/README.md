OpenFL IAP Sample
===

Graphics from Lost Garden (See License: http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/03/lost-garden-license.html)

This sample makes use of the features that the OpenFL IAP extension has to offer. It works for both iOS
and Android, and also illustrates how you can address the differences between those targets.

If for any reason the IAP service is not working, this sample gracefully falls back and uses a local data model.

The sample features a town where you can buy houses, stores and other buildings using gold as currency. 
If you need more gold you can purchase more at the store (using IAP).

You can also choose to upgrade your buildings by first purchasing the level 2 unlock. (In progress).
